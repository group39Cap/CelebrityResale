Celebrity Resale Platform
 Problem Statement
 Celebrities often accumulate a vast wardrobe of clothing, shoes, and jewelry, many of which are worn only a few times or exclusively at 
high-profile events. Current resale platforms fail to cater to the exclusivity and authenticity that both celebrities and their fans desire. 
Fans want genuine access to items worn by their favorite stars, while celebrities need a trustworthy and efficient way to monetize and 
manage these sales without damaging their brand image. Existing platforms like Depop and Poshmark lack the unique blend of 
exclusivity, verification, and engagement tailored for this niche.
